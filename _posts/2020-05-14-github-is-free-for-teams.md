We’re happy to bring you this exciting news that Github is making private repositories with unlimited collaborators available to all GitHub accounts.
**All of the core GitHub features are now free for everyone. 🎉**

Until now, if your organization wanted to use GitHub for private development, you had to subscribe to one of our paid plans.
But every developer on earth should have access to GitHub. They told that **Price shouldn’t be a barrier.**

This means teams can now manage their work together in one place: CI/CD, project management, code review, packages, and more.
Github allows everyone to be able to ship great software on the platform developers love.

Teams who need advanced features (like code owners), enterprise features (like SAML), or personalized support can upgrade to one of our paid plans.

Github is also reducing the price of paid Team plan from **$9 per user/month to $4 per user/month**, effective immediately.
Existing customers will have their bills automatically reduced going forward.

We will come up with a new mlog how to use these features for effective devlopment of your project.
